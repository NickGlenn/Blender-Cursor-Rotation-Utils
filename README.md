# Cursor Rotation for Blender 2.9

> :construction_worker: **This project is a work in progress**.

This is a rather small and simple add-on for Blender 2.9 that provides two new operators for working with the 3D cursor. Blender added the ability in 2.8 to rotate the 3D cursor, however, the functionality seems largely under utilized by default. Hoping to mimic the functionality of Modo's "Work Plane", this add-on was created for aligning the cursor to selected objects, mesh components, and bones.

> This add-on _should_ be compatible with 2.8+, but has only been tested on 2.9
